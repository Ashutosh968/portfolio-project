# Portfolio Website
- This is my first attempt at creating a potfolio website.
- It is created with usage of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- Has a theme-based viewing approach, i.e., rather than the regular light-dark viewing modes
  it has different colour schemes using CSS files controlled by a JS switch.
